In severe cases, diphtheria can cause paralysis, heart failure, kidney failure, and in some instances, death.
It is crucial to seek medical attention promptly if diphtheria is suspected, as early treatment can
significantly improve outcomes.
Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease that
can result in prolonged coughing spells lasting for weeks. In severe cases, it can lead to difficulty
breathing, pneumonia, and other serious complications.
Tetanus is a serious medical condition that results in excruciating muscle contractions. In children,
it can lead to the locking of neck and jaw muscles, a condition commonly known as lockjaw. This can
make it extremely difficult for children to perform basic functions such as opening their mouth,
swallowing, breastfeeding, or even breathing. Unfortunately, even with proper treatment, tetanus can often
prove to be fatal.
Haemophilus influenzae type b is a bacterium that can cause serious diseases such as meningitis
and pneumonia in infants and young children. These bacteria are commonly found in the human
nasopharynx and can be transmitted to others through droplets from nasopharyngeal secretions.
